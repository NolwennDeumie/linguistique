# The American war of Independence, 1775-1783

  

In the beginning of year 1775, Americans plundered armories and organized militias. However, the american forces were way inferior compared to the british army, quality and means included. Violent actions multiplied, in a speech made in St. John church in Richmond, Virginia, Patrick Henry demanded “Liberty or death”.

  

## First fights in the North, 1775

  

The first battle opposing british soldiers to Americans was the **Lexington and Concord** one, a few kilometers west of Boston (April 19, 1775) : this skirmish (*escarmouche**), which end was in favor of the insurgents, caused 73 british deaths and 49 american deaths. It was the beginning of a guerilla.  
**On May 10, 1775**, the day Americans took the Ticonderoga Fort, **was the first reunion of the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia**. This congress named **George Washington as the head of the continental army** on June 15. The general had to deal with seriously undisciplined troops. At the beginning of the war, money lacked to pay soldiers and desertion was frequent. However, Americans were deeply determined.

  

The Congress called out Canada again. On July 8, they sent the [**Olive Branch Petition**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tition_du_rameau_d%27olivier) to George III, a conciliation attempt rejected by the king. Americans besieged (*assiéger*) Boston (April 19, 1775 - March 17, 1776) and lost the battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. They finally withdrew to New-Scotland on March 17, 1776.

The american troops also invaded Canada and occupied Montréal, however, the population was quite resistant and the canadian winter won over them, they fled the city at the end of 1775.

  

## Political revolution, 1776-1777

  

On January 10, **1776**, **Thomas Paine** published a pamphlet called ***Common Sense***, in which he criticized monarchy and had an important succes. Thomas Paine wanted America to split from Great Britain and proposed a republican constitution. In a letter published by the Pennsylvania Packet on April 22, 1776, he showed Americans every advantages of being independent. Independency would bring happiness. To Thomas Paine’s opinion, Americans were a free and virtuous people who could liberate itself from the past.

  

**Between 1776 and 1780, the American States gave themselves written constitutions based on faith into public virtues.**
The texts planned two assemblies and annual elections: the democratic principle was adopted everywhere by **censitary suffrage** (*suffrage censitaire, opposé au suffrage équivalent, les votes n’ont pas la même valeur en fonction du rang de la personne*), but not in Vermont where universal suffrage was granted to white men.

The [**Constitution of Virginia**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_de_Virginie) (June 1776) affirmed human rights, some of which would be taken up (*reprendre qch*) in the United States Declaration of Independence: **it’s the first time in human History that a constitutional text stated universal and inalienable rights**. The Constitution of Pennsylvania (September 1776) implemented [conscientious objection](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objection_de_conscience) (= objection de conscience) and religious tolerance. The constitutions of five States out of thirteen stated the need of public instruction.

  

In Philadelphia, after numerous debates, **the Continental Congress voted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776**. This text, its main author being **Thomas Jefferson**, represented the “inaugural act of the American nation”. Its preamble (= préambule), inspired by the Lumières’ ideas, proclaimed the **right to freedom, life and happiness** for settlers.

  

## British movement to the center, 1776-1777

  

After Long Island’s victory in August 1776, Richard Howe’s **british troops occupied New-York city** in September. The american troops, led by George Washington, had to withdraw to New Jersey. In spite of Trenton’s (December 26, 1776) and Princeton’s (January 3, 1777) successes, **Philadelphia was occupied in Fall 1777** : Congress had to flee the city, as well as two thirds of the population. Washington got defeated in Pennsylvania (battles of Brandywine and Germantown), and to go to Valley Forge for the Winter, in awful conditions. However, **after Saratoga’s battle**, in the state of New-York, **British commander John Burgoyne had to surrender in Horatio Gates on October 17, 1777**. This american victory encouraged France to engage in war, helping the insurgents.

  

## French alliance and final victory, 1778-1783

  

**An alliance treaty got ratified on February 6, 1778, in Paris between France and the United States**, thanks to Benjamin Franklin’s diplomatic action. French hoped to get their revenge on Great Britain. Spain joined the alliance in May 1779, followed by the Dutch Republic in 1780.

  

On June 18, 1778, **british troops left Philadelphia in order to go defend New-York, threatened by a French maritime intervention**. The battle of Monmouth, New Jersey (June 28, 1778), was an american success. But as of (*à partir de*) 1779, the British attacked the Southern states : Savannah, Georgia, got occupied. The city’s siege was organized by French and Americans but failed in October 1791.

Between May 1780 and September 1781, a **series of battles happened in South Carolina, sometimes in favor of London** (Charleston, May 1780, or Camden, August 1780), **sometimes in favor of the Americans** (King’s Mountain, October 1780, or Eutaw Springs, September 1781). **The british defeat during the battle of Yorktown**, Virginia, in **October 1781**, marked a turning point in the war.

**The House of Commons** adjudicated (*se prononcer*) for the end of the war on February 1782, british Prime Minister Lord North resigned on March 20, 1782. The british troops left Savannah on July 1782, then Charleston in December. **Negotiations started with the Crown and a preliminary treaty was agreed on November, 30, 1782**.

  

The **Treaty of Paris**, ratified on September 3, **1783**, officially ended hostilities and the United States was acknowledged once and for all. Its frontier was the Mississippi river.

  

The **Peace of Paris**, signed the same year, **resolved the litigations between Great Britain and the European allies of America.**

## The birth of Confederation, 1777-1781

  

The american unity advanced in 1777 : a flag got adopted in June.

The coordination of military efforts against Great Britain and the supplies given to the Continental army drove the Americans to unite. Loans and the debt reimbursement also needed a reinforcement of federalist centralisation : the war of Independence led to the union of the old colonies.

  

On November 15, **1777**, the [**Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union**](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_de_la_Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration)  were voted by the Continental Congress. **This constitutional document organized the Thirteen States as a Confederation** (union of sovereign states, united for purposes of common action often in relation to other states, it tends to be created in order to deal with critical issues), and declared the existence of the United States, letting the federal States their own sovereignty. **The document imposed a mutual armed help, an elected congress to represent the country in international relationships and judge disputes between States.**

Then, the United States created and ambassad, a national Treasury (*Trésor public*) and a bank. Titles of nobility were abolished and the first ministries were implemented.

The Articles of Confederation were put in place only after being ratified by the States, i.e. in March 1781. However, for its financial resources, Congress mostly depended on the willing of the States. Nothing was intended for the Congress to prevail its authority on the States, the belief in public virtue being so strong.

  

Only a low percentage of the 2.5 million inhabitants was volunteer to fight against British. **States refused to give supplies to continental army’s troops. Soldiers suffered from lack of food and clothing.**

  
The elaboration of the Articles of Confederation brought up **oppositions between those who wanted a strong central power and those who were in favor of a huge autonomy for the States**. The first ones got called “nationalists”, then **“federalists”**. Debates were also about the distribution of fiscal charges, the way to vote and the expansion to the West.
