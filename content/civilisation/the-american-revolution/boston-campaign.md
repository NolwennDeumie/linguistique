It is often said that the American war of Independence began with the British on April 19, 1775, during Boston siege ([battles of Concord and Lexington](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batailles_de_Lexington_et_Concord)) but the first event that triggered the popular reaction to english invasion started with whatâ€™s known as the **Powder Alarm**.

On September 1st, 1774, british soldiers confiscated powder supplies and weapons from the militia during a surprise action near Boston. This expedition alarmed the entire country and american patriots ran into action, persuaded war had begun. Even though this alarm was false, it enticed everyone to be more careful.
